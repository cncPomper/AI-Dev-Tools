# End-to-End 02 Application Development

In this homework, we'll build an end-to-end application with AI.

**Unleash your creativity with your AI companion of choice!** Whether you prefer powerful chat interfaces like ChatGPT or Claude, or the seamless integration of an IDE assistant such as GitHub Copilot, Codex, or Cursor (even Antigravity if you're feeling adventurous!), feel free to leverage any tool that empowers your development.

Just a heads-up: with traditional chat-based applications, you'll often find yourself copying code back and forth. For a more streamlined and efficient workflow, we highly recommend utilizing an AI assistant that offers an agent mode directly within your IDE.

We will implement a platform for online coding interviews.

The app should be able to do the following:

*   Create a link and share it with candidates
*   Allow everyone who connects to edit code in the code panel
*   Show real-time updates to all connected users
*   Support syntax highlighting for multiple languages
*   Execute code safely in the browser

You can choose any technologies you want. For example:

*   Frontend: React + Vite
*   Backend: Express.js

We recommend using JavaScript for frontend, because with other technologies, some of the homework requirements may be difficult to implement.

But you can experiment with alternatives, such as Streamlit.

You don't need to know these technologies for doing this homework.
